@chapter PCI Library

@cindex libpci

@section Introduction

The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus is a very common computer
bus architecture that is found in almost every PC today. The PCI bus is
normally located at the motherboard where some PCI devices are soldered
directly onto the PCB and expansion slots allows the user to add custom
devices easily. There is a wide range of PCI hardware available implementing
all sorts of interfaces and functions.

This section describes the PCI Library available in RTEMS used to access the
PCI bus in a portable way across computer architectures supported by RTEMS.

The PCI Library aims to be compatible with PCI 2.3 with a couple of
limitations, for example there is no support for hot-plugging, 64-bit
memory space and cardbus bridges.

In order to support different architectures and with small foot-print embedded
systems in mind the PCI Library offers four different configuration options
listed below. It is selected during compile time by defining the appropriate
macros in confdefs.h.
@itemize @bullet
@item Auto Configuration (do Plug & Play)
@item Read Configuration (read BIOS or boot loader configuration)
@item Static Configuration (write user defined configuration)
@item Peripheral Configuration (no access to cfg-space)
@end itemize

@section Background

The PCI bus is constructed in a way where on-board devices and devices
in expansion slots can be automatically found (probed) and configured
using Plug & Play completely implemented in software. The bus is set up once
during boot up. The Plug & Play information can be read and written from
PCI configuration space. A PCI device is identified in configuration space by
a unique bus, slot and function number. Each PCI slot can have up to 8
functions and interface to another PCI sub-bus by implementing a PCI-to-PCI
bridge according to the PCI Bridge Architecture specification.

Using the unique [bus:slot:func] any device can be configured regardless how PCI
is currently set up as long as all PCI buses are enumerated correctly. The
enumration is done during probing, all bridges are given a bus numbers in
order for the bridges to respond to accesses from both directions. The PCI
library can assign address ranges to which a PCI device should respond using
Plug & Play technique or a static user defined configuration. After the
configuration has been performed the PCI device drivers can find devices by
the read-only PCI Class type, Vendor ID and Device ID information found in
configuration space for each device.

In some systems there is a boot loader or BIOS which have already configured
all PCI devices, but on embedded targets it is quite common that there is no
BIOS or boot loader, thus RTEMS must configure the PCI bus. Only the PCI host
may do configuration space access, the host driver or BSP is responsible to
translate the [bus:slot:func] into a valid PCI configuration space access.

If the target is not a host, but a peripheral, configuration space can not be
accessed, the peripheral is set up by the host during start up. In complex
embedded PCI systems the peripheral may need to access other PCI boards than
then host. In such systems a custom (static) configuration of both the host
and peripheral may be a convenient solution.

The PCI bus defines four interrupt signals INTA#..INTD#. The interrupt signals
must be mapped into a system interrupt/vector, it is up to the BSP or host
driver to know the mapping, however the BIOS or boot loader may use the
8-bit read/write "Interrupt Line" register to pass the knowledge along to the
OS.


 The PCI standard
defines and recommends that the backplane route the interupt lines in a
systematic way, however in 

@subsection Software Components

The PCI library is located in cpukit/libpci, it consists of different parts:
@itemize @bullet
@item PCI Host bridge driver interface
@item Configuration routines
@item Access (Configuration, I/O and Memory space) routines
@item Interrupt routines (implemented by BSP)
@item Print routines
@item Static/peripheral configuration creation
@item PCI shell command
@end itemize

@subsection PCI Configuration

During start up the PCI bus must be configured in order for host and peripherals
to access one another using Memory or I/O accesses and that interrupts are
properly handled. Three different spaces are defined and mapped separately:
@enumerate
@item I/O space (IO)
@item non-prefetchable Memory space (MEMIO)
@item prefetchable Memory space (MEM)
@end enumerate

Regions of the same type (I/O or Memory) may not overlap which is guaranteed
by the software. MEM regions may be mapped into MEMIO regions, but MEMIO
regions can not be mapped into MEM, for that could lead to prefetching of
registers. The interrupt pin which a board is driving can be read out from
PCI configuration space, however it is up to software to know how interrupt
signals are routed between PCI-to-PCI bridges and how PCI INT[A..D]# pins are
mapped to system IRQ. In systems where previous software (boot loader or BIOS)
has already set up this the configuration overwritten or simply read out.

In order to support different configuration methods the following configuration
libraries are available can selectable by the user:
@itemize @bullet
@item Auto Configuration (run Plug & Play software)
@item Read Configuration (relies on a boot loader or BIOS)
@item Static Configuration (write user defined setup, no Plug & Play)
@item Peripheral Configuration (user defined setup, no access to configuration space)
@end itemize

A host driver can be made to support all three configuration methods, or any
combination. It may be defined by the BSP which approach is used.

The configuration software is called from the PCI driver (pci_config_init()).

Regardless of configuration method a PCI device tree is created in RAM during
initialization, the tree can be accessed to find devices and resources without
accessing configuration space later on. The user is responsible to create the
device tree at compile time when using the static/peripheral method.


@subsubsection RTEMS Configuration selection

The active configuration method can be selected at compile time in the same
way as other project parameters by including rtems/confdefs.h and setting
@itemize @bullet
@item CONFIGURE_INIT
@item RTEMS_PCI_CONFIG_LIB
@item CONFIGURE_PCI_LIB = PCI_LIB_(AUTO,STATIC,READ,PERIPHERAL)
@end itemize

See the RTEMS configuration section how to setup the PCI library.


@subsubsection Auto Configuration

The auto configuration software enumerate PCI buses and initializes all PCI
devices found using Plug & Play. The auto configuration software requires
that a configuration setup has been registered by the driver or BSP in order
to setup the I/O and Memory regions at the correct address ranges. PCI
interrupt pins can optionally be routed over PCI-to-PCI bridges and mapped
to a system interrupt number. Resources are sorted by size and required
alignment, unused "dead" space may be created when PCI bridges are present
due to the PCI bridge window size does not equal the alignment, to cope with
that resources are reordered to fit smaller BARs into the dead space to minimize
the PCI space required. If a BAR or ROM register can not be allocated a PCI
address region (due to too few resources available) the register will be given
the value of pci_invalid_address which defaults to 0.

The auto configuration routines support:
@itemize @bullet
@item PCI 2.3
@item Little and big endian PCI bus
@item one I/O 16 or 32-bit range (IO)
@item memory space (MEMIO)
@item prefetchable memory space (MEM), if not present MEM will be mapped into
      MEMIO
@item multiple PCI buses - PCI-to-PCI bridges
@item standard BARs, PCI-to-PCI bridge BARs, ROM BARs
@item Interrupt routing over bridges
@item Interrupt pin to system interrupt mapping
@end itemize

Not supported:
@itemize @bullet
@item hot-pluggable devices
@item Cardbus bridges
@item 64-bit memory space
@item 16-bit and 32-bit I/O address ranges at the same time
@end itemize

In PCI 2.3 there may exist I/O BARs that must be located at the low 64kBytes
address range, in order to support this the host driver or BSP must make sure
that I/O addresses region is within this region.


@subsubsection Read Configuration

When a BIOS or boot loader already has setup the PCI bus the configuration can
be read directly from the PCI resource registers and buses are already
enumerated, this is a much simpler approach than configuring PCI ourselves. The
PCI device tree is automatically created based on the current configuration and
devices present. After initialization is done there is no difference between
the auto or read configuration approaches.


@subsubsection Static Configuration

To support custom configurations and small-footprint PCI systems, the user may
provide the PCI device tree which contains the current configuration. The
PCI buses are enumerated and all resources are written to PCI devices during
initialization. When this approach is selected PCI boards must be located at
the same slots every time and devices can not be removed or added, Plug & Play
is not performed. Boards of the same type may of course be exchanged.

The user can create a configuration by calling pci_cfg_print() on a running
system that has had PCI setup by the auto or read configuration routines, it
can be called from the PCI shell command. The user must provide the PCI device
tree named pci_hb.


@subsubsection Peripheral Configuration

On systems where a peripheral PCI device needs to access other PCI devices than
the host the peripheral configuration approach may be handy. Most PCI devices
answers on the PCI host's requests and start DMA accesses into the Hosts memory,
however in some complex systems PCI devices may want to access other devices
on the same bus or at another PCI bus.

A PCI peripheral is not allowed to do PCI configuration cycles, which means that
is must either rely on the host to give it the addresses it needs, or that the
addresses are predefined.

This configuration approach is very similar to the static option, however the
configuration is never written to PCI bus, instead it is only used for drivers
to find PCI devices and resources using the same PCI API as for the host


@subsection PCI Access

The PCI access routines are low-level routines provided for drivers,
configuration software, etc. in order to access different regions in way not
dependent upon the host driver, BSP or platform:
@itemize @bullet
@item PCI configuration space
@item PCI I/O space
@item Registers over PCI memory space
@item Translate PCI address into CPU accessible address and vice verse
@end itemize

By using the access routines drivers can be made portable over different
architectures. The access routines take the architecture endianess into
consideration and let the host driver or BSP implement I/O space and
configuration space access.

Some non-standard hardware may also define the PCI bus big-endian, for example
the LEON2 AT697 PCI host bridge and some LEON3 systems may be configured that
way. It is up to the BSP to set the appropriate PCI endianess on compile time
(CONFIGURE_PCI_BIG_ENDIAN).

@subsubsection Configuration space

Configuration space is accessed using the routines listed below.

@example
  /* Configuration Space Access Read Routines */
  extern int pci_cfg_r8(pci_dev_t dev, int ofs, uint8_t *data);
  extern int pci_cfg_r16(pci_dev_t dev, int ofs, uint16_t *data);
  extern int pci_cfg_r32(pci_dev_t dev, int ofs, uint32_t *data);

  /* Configuration Space Access Write Routines */
  extern int pci_cfg_w8(pci_dev_t dev, int ofs, uint8_t data);
  extern int pci_cfg_w16(pci_dev_t dev, int ofs, uint16_t data);
  extern int pci_cfg_w32(pci_dev_t dev, int ofs, uint32_t data);
@end example

@subsubsection I/O space

The BSP or driver provide special routines in order to access I/O space. Some
architectures have a special instruction accessing I/O space, others have it
mapped into the standard address space accessed by the CPU over a window. The
window size may vary and must be taken into consideration by the driver. The
below routes must be used to access I/O space:

@example
/* Read a register over PCI I/O Space */
extern uint8_t pci_io_r8(uint32_t adr);
extern uint16_t pci_io_r16(uint32_t adr);
extern uint32_t pci_io_r32(uint32_t adr);

/* Write a register over PCI I/O Space */
extern void pci_io_w8(uint32_t adr, uint8_t data);
extern void pci_io_w16(uint32_t adr, uint16_t data);
extern void pci_io_w32(uint32_t adr, uint32_t data);
@end example

@subsubsection Registers over Memory space

PCI host bridge hardware normally swap data accesses into the endianess of the
host architecture in order to lower the load of the CPU, peripherals can do DMA
without swapping. However, the host controller can not separate a standard
memory access from a memory access to a register, registers may be mapped into
memory space. This leads to register content being swapped, which must be
swapped back. The below routines makes it possible to access registers over PCI
memory space in a portable way on different architectures, the BSP or
architecture must provide necessary functions in order to implement this.

@example
  static inline uint16_t pci_ld_le16(volatile uint16_t *addr);
  static inline void pci_st_le16(volatile uint16_t *addr, uint16_t val);
  static inline uint32_t pci_ld_le32(volatile uint32_t *addr);
  static inline void pci_st_le32(volatile uint32_t *addr, uint32_t val);
  static inline uint16_t pci_ld_be16(volatile uint16_t *addr);
  static inline void pci_st_be16(volatile uint16_t *addr, uint16_t val);
  static inline uint32_t pci_ld_be32(volatile uint32_t *addr);
  static inline void pci_st_be32(volatile uint32_t *addr, uint32_t val);
@end example

In order to support non-standard big-endian PCI bus the above pci_* functions
is required, pci_ld_le16 != ld_le16 on big endian PCI buses. 


@subsubsection PCI address translation

When PCI addresses, both I/O and memory space, is not mapped 1:1 address
translation before access is needed. If drivers read the PCI resources directly
using configuration space routines or in the device tree, the addresses given
are PCI addresses. The below function can be used to translate PCI addresses
into CPU accessible.

@example
  /* Translate PCI address into CPU accessible address
   * *address is in/out
   */
  static inline int pci_address(void **address, int type);
@end example

@subsection PCI Shell command

The RTEMS shell have a PCI command 'pci' which makes it possible to read/write
configuration space, print the current PCI configuration and print out a
configuration C-file for the static or peripheral library.
