 *  Used by device drivers. The functions rely on that the parent bus driver
 *  has implemented the neccessary operations correctly.
 *
 *  The translate functions are used to translate addresses between buses
 *  for DMA cores located on a "remote" bus, or for memory-mapped obtaining
 *  an address that can be used to access an remote bus.
 *
 *  For example, PCI I/O might be memory-mapped at the PCI Host bridge,
 *  say address 0xfff10000-0xfff1ffff is mapped to the PCI I/O address
 *  of 0x00000000-0x0000ffff. The PCI Host bridge driver may then set up
 *  a map so that a driver that get PCI address 0x100 can translate that
 *  into 0xfff10100.
