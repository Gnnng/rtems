  Added support for ROM BARs at devices and PCI-PCI bridges.

  Split Library into different parts, this enables PCI initialization to be done
  outside of the PCI Host driver and smaller systems that don't want
  Configuration Space to be setup.
    - Access Library (Configuration, Memory and I/O Space read/write routines)
    - Configuration Libarary
        A. Auto Config
        B. Static Config (not implemented yet)
    - Interrupt Library (shared interrupt support rely on BSP)
  This file created.

  Changed library to use 16-bit identifiers (pci_dev_t), instead to 3 integers
  (BUS,SLOT,FUNC), this reduces the footprint.

  Fixed I/O BAR size calculation of bridges. Reading/Writing to 0x1C instead of
  faulty 0x1E.

  Fix in pci_res_insert(), where the above mentioned optimization failed due to
  bad compare statement. Optimization only affects systems with multiple PCI
  buses.

  Optimized resource allocation when bridges are present: the resources lists
  are sorted by boundary instead of size and a reorder aligorithm introduced
  that move resources into unused areas if possible.

  Fixed autoconf issue when bridges are present

  Fixed initialization problem when first device is a bridge.

 2010-02-03, Daniel Hellstrom <daniel@gaisler.com>
  PCI Library rewritten from scratch. Support multiple buses/bridges, print
  current PCI configuration space setup, BAR assigment sort implementation
  speeded up drastically (bootup time noticable shorter), interrupt assignment
  implemented, PCI Host driver extracted from library, support for I/O areas.
